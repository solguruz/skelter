## Getting Started
**Skelter** is a production-ready **Flutter starter** designed to help teams ship high-quality apps faster. It‚Äôs open-source, scalable, and built with proven patterns so you can focus on delivering features‚Äînot boilerplate.

### Flavors

This project supports three flavors:

- **dev**
- **stage**
- **prod**

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following values:

```
DEV_API_BASE_URL=https://dev.example.com/api
STAGE_API_BASE_URL=https://stage.example.com/api
PROD_API_BASE_URL=https://prod.example.com/api
```

Replace the URLs with your actual API endpoints.

### Building APK/IPA

To build for a specific flavor, use the following commands:

**Android APK (dev flavor):**

```
flutter build apk --flavor dev --dart-define=APP_FLAVOR=DEV
```

**iOS IPA (prod flavor):**

```
flutter build ipa --export-method=ad-hoc --flavor prod --dart-define=APP_FLAVOR=PROD 
```

### SSL Certificate Hash Setup

Follow these steps to configure SSL pinning in your Flutter project.

1. **Add Certificate Hash Variables to `.env`**  
   Add the SHA-256 SSL public key fingerprints for each flavor:

   ```
   CERT_HASH_DEV="add_your_dev_hash_here"
   CERT_HASH_STAGE="add_your_stage_hash_here"
   CERT_HASH_PROD="add_your_prod_hash_here"
   ```

2. **Get Your Certificate Hash**  
   Run the following command (replace `yourdomain.com` with your API domain):

   ```bash
   openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443 -servername yourdomain.com </dev/null 2>/dev/null \
     | openssl x509 -pubkey -noout \
     | openssl pkey -pubin -outform DER \
     | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary \
     | openssl enc -base64
   ```

   **Example output:**
   ```
   406f8ac14c60a793be7aa284fc61a3cdcdbd79aa8c59cef535baffefd7278a5d
   ```
   Copy this value into the matching `CERT_HASH_*` variable in your `.env` file.

3. **Use the Certificate Hash in Code**  
   Add a method to fetch the correct hash for the current flavor:

   ```dart
   String _getCertHash() {
     final hash = switch (AppConfig.appFlavor) {
           AppFlavor.dev => dotenv.env['CERT_HASH_DEV'],
           AppFlavor.stage => dotenv.env['CERT_HASH_STAGE'],
           AppFlavor.prod => dotenv.env['CERT_HASH_PROD'],
         } ?? '';

     if (hash.isEmpty) {
       throw Exception(
         '[SSL Pinning] CertificateHash not found for: ${AppConfig.appFlavor.name}',
       );
     }

     debugPrint('[SSL Pinning] SHA-256 hash: "$hash"');
     return hash;
   }
   ```

## Architecture and Coding Standards

This project follows a clean architecture approach with BLoC pattern for state management, ensuring:

### Code Organization

- **Separation of Concerns**: UI, business logic, and data access are kept separate
- **Modular Structure**: Features are organized into independent modules
- **Dependency Injection**: Services and repositories are properly injected
- **Testability**: All components are designed to be easily testable
- **Widget Best Practices**: Keep widgets small and create classes instead of helper methods
- **Bloc Usage**: Get values from bloc with context.select() instead of passing in widget parameters

### BLoC Architecture

The project uses the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern to separate business logic from UI:

- **Events**: Input events triggered by user interactions
- **States**: Output states representing UI changes
- **BLoCs**: Components that convert events to states

Code structure follows this pattern:

```
feature/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bloc/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature_bloc.dart
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature_event.dart
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature_state.dart
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repository/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ screens/
```

### Coding Guidelines

- Use `final` and `const` where appropriate
- Follow the [Flutter style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Keep methods small and focused
- Write meaningful comments for complex logic
- Use proper naming conventions (camelCase for variables/methods, PascalCase for classes)

## Localization

The project is set up with Flutter's internationalization system:

- Localization files are located in `lib/i18n/`
- Base ARB file is `app_en.arb`
- The output localization file is `app_localizations.dart`

To add a new language:

1. Create a new ARB file in the `lib/i18n/` directory (e.g., `app_es.arb`)
2. Run `flutter gen-l10n` to generate localization code
3. Access translations using `AppLocalizations.of(context).translationKey`

## Assets Management

Assets are organized as follows:

- **Icons**: Located in `assets/icons/` (SVG and PNG formats)
- **Images**: Located in `assets/images/`
- **Fonts**: Located in `assets/fonts/Inter/`

The project uses code generation for type-safe asset access. When adding new assets:

1. Add the asset to the appropriate directory
2. Run `flutter pub run build_runner build` to update generated asset references
3. Access assets using the generated constants

## Golden Testing

The project uses Alchemist for golden testing, a powerful tool for UI regression testing.

### What are Golden Tests?

Golden tests compare the rendered UI to a "golden" reference image. This helps detect unintended
visual changes during development.

### How to Use Golden Tests

1. **Creating a Golden Test**:
   ```dart
   goldenTest(
     'Widget renders correctly',
     builder: () => GoldenTestGroup(
       children: [
         GoldenTestScenario(
           name: 'default state',
           child: YourWidget(),
         ),
       ],
     ),
   );
   ```

2. **Running Tests**:
   ```bash
   flutter test --update-goldens test/golden_test.dart  # Update golden files
   flutter test test/golden_test.dart                   # Run tests against existing golden files
   ```

3. **Managing Golden Files**:
    - Golden files are stored in the `/golden/macos` and `/golden/linux`' directory
    - Use `copy_golden_images.sh` script to copy golden images to the linux directory for CI/CD
      environments

For more details, refer to the **Technical Document on Golden Test Cases** and **alchemist**
library.
