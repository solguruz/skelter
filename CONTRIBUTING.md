## Git Workflow & Contribution Guidelines

### Branching Strategy

We use GitHub for version control with the following branch structure:

- `master`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/[feature-name]`: For new features
- `bugfix/[bug-description]`: For bug fixes
- `hotfix/[hotfix-description]`: For urgent production fixes

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a branch from `develop` for your task
2. Make your changes and test thoroughly
3. Push your branch and create a Merge Request to `develop`
4. Ensure CI passes and request reviews
5. Address review comments
6. Request for review and merge the PR

### Commit Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference issue numbers in commits and PRs
- Keep commits focused on single logical changes

## How to Contribute

2. Pick an issue from the issue tracker or create a new one
